What are we planning to do?

 - Work with Python as beginners to learn a front end
 - MongoDB to connect to a live db to fetch information with CRUD operations (Create, Reading, Updating, and Deleting)
 - Testing basic functionality with PostMan (send raw data to see how localhost is interacting)

 Road Map to learning?
1. How do you use python to program front end / back end html structure?
    -> If we were to use Vue.JS this is a front end technology:
        - Frontend JavaScript framework
        - Used for building user interfaces and single-page applications
        - Focuses on the view layer of an application
        - Handles rendering and updating of UI components
        - Can be incrementally adopted in existing projects
    
    -> Meanwhile Django is a backend frame work used for:
        - Backend Python web framework
        - Used for server-side logic and database operations
        - Provides a full-stack solution, including an ORM, authentication, and admin interface
        - Follows the model-template-view (MTV) architectural pattern
        - Well-suited for developing complex, database-driven web applications
