What are we planning to do?

 - Work with Python as beginners to learn a front end
 - MongoDB to connect to a live db to fetch information with CRUD operations (Create, Reading, Updating, and Deleting)
 - Testing basic functionality with PostMan (send raw data to see how localhost is interacting)

 Road Map to learning?
1. How do you use python to program front end / back end html structure?
    -> If we were to use Vue.JS this is a front end technology:
        - Frontend JavaScript framework
        - Used for building user interfaces and single-page applications
        - Focuses on the view layer of an application
        - Handles rendering and updating of UI components
        - Can be incrementally adopted in existing projects
    
    -> Meanwhile Django is a backend frame work used for:
        - Backend Python web framework
        - Used for server-side logic and database operations
        - Provides a full-stack solution, including an ORM, authentication, and admin interface
        - Follows the model-template-view (MTV) architectural pattern
        - Well-suited for developing complex, database-driven web applications

How They Interact

Frontend (React/Vue.js) and Backend (Django):
React or Vue.js handles the client-side (frontend) part of the application. This is what the user interacts with in the browser.
Django serves as the backend, where it handles requests, processes data, and returns responses (like JSON data or rendered 
templates). The frontend typically makes HTTP requests to Django's REST API (which might be built using Django Rest Framework) 
to fetch or send data.
